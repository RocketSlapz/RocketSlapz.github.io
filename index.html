        <p> DDR5 RAM has just been released to a few select people. You can find their videos on websites like Youtube, and other video websites that have Computer videos. In my opinion the first releases of DDR5 RAM are  money shcemes. Manufacturers made DDR5 not compatible with DDR4 slots, so you potentially will have to buy a new motherboard to access them. Therefore bringing more money to <strong>ONLY</strong> the companies that produce such motherboards.
This technically means they are controlling your options and money. This could be considered monopoly.</p>

        <p> People have found many different builds and ways to cool computer systems. Whether it be liquid cooling or just fans there are ways to do it right, and efficient. The most common cooling sytems are air-cooled or fans, but may not be enough for your plans. Almost all office computers, school computers, and home computers are air cooled. Even for most of the high end rigs, if everything is set the right way can be correctly cooled. If your setting up your own cooling system using fans, you need to everything mapped out to fit properly. You also need to clarify your intake and exhaust points. Make sure everything gets clean fresh airflow at all times. Liquid cooling should <strong>only</strong> be used for higher end performance rigs.Liquid cooling is more costly and more work. You can get an AIO which is a type of CPU liquid cooler that should only be used if you plan to overclock your CPU or if you think your cpu is not getting enough airflow. If you want to liquid cool your whole PC you can find tutorials on Youtube. </p>
